GestureBridge – AI-Powered Sign Language Communication Platform

GestureBridge is an AI-powered web application developed to improve communication between sign language users and people who communicate using spoken or written language. The platform combines artificial intelligence, computer vision, and modern web technologies to provide an accessible, real-time communication experience while also supporting sign language learning.

The system uses a webcam to capture live video and processes each frame using MediaPipe and OpenCV to extract hand and body landmarks. These landmarks are converted into numerical data and passed to a trained deep learning model that recognizes sign language gestures. The predicted sign is then converted into readable text, allowing users who do not understand sign language to follow the conversation in real time.

In addition to gesture recognition, GestureBridge provides a collaborative learning platform where users can upload, browse, and practice sign language videos. Videos are organized by category and difficulty level, making it easier for learners to discover and practice new signs. The platform also includes search and filtering capabilities to improve accessibility and navigation.

The application follows a client-server architecture with a React.js frontend and a Flask backend. REST APIs enable seamless communication between the user interface, machine learning models, and the MongoDB database. Secure user authentication allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles while maintaining data integrity.

The project has been designed with scalability and accessibility as primary goals. Its modular architecture makes it easy to integrate additional sign languages, improve recognition accuracy with new AI models, and expand the platform with features such as real-time video communication, speech-to-sign translation, multilingual support, and mobile applications.
